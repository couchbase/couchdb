-module(file2).

% This module is a workaround against a Windows specific issue when
% doing some file operations concurrently. The issue is that some file
% operations from the 'file' module (such as file:read_file_info/1,2)
% do not open files with all the Windows share flags (FILE_SHARE_READ,
% FILE_SHARE_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_DELETE) - this makes it impossible for
% certain file operations to be done concurrently by different Erlang
% processes against the same file. In this case, all but one of the
% operations, will fail with the Windows error FILE_SHARE_VIOLATION,
% which the Erlang file driver maps to the POSIX error EACCES. This
% applies up to Erlang OTP R15B02 at least (a patch was submitted to
% add all the share flags to all file open operations done by the
% Erlang Windows file driver).
% The same type of issue happens when external processes are holding
% files open without all the share flags. Examples are Windows specific
% background indexing services and antivirus software.
%
% This module ensures we retry file operations (on Windows) for a
% limited period of time if they fail with error EACCES.
